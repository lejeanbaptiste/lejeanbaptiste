/**
 * Render smoke test for the source-code panel.
 *
 * Added to give the panel's mount/unmount path any coverage at all — it had none,
 * which is how a broken teardown survived here unnoticed (see the note above the
 * mount effect in Editor.tsx). The dispose assertion below is what pins that
 * down: with the original cleanup, which closed over the initial `editor` state
 * rather than the instance it created, the Monaco editor was never disposed on
 * unmount.
 *
 * THIS VERIFIES LIFECYCLE, NOT EDITING. A green run means the panel mounts,
 * subscribes, and disposes what it created. It says nothing about whether the
 * editor renders or reflects the document — real Monaco cannot run under jsdom,
 * so it is stubbed throughout. Reading this suite as "the source panel works"
 * would be a misread; that still needs the running app.
