# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately by email to
<daniel.morgan@college-de-france.fr>. Do not open a public issue for
security problems. You should normally receive a reply within a week.

## Release integrity

Every release asset can be verified in the following ways.

### macOS packages

The `.pkg` installers (and the apps inside the `.zip` archives) are signed
with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple. Gatekeeper
verifies both automatically on install. To check manually:

    pkgutil --check-signature <package>.pkg
    spctl --assess -vv --type install <package>.pkg

### Linux packages

The apt repository is signed; apt verifies every download against the
archive key (`le-jean-baptiste-archive-key.asc`, attached to each release),
which is the CI signing subkey of the release key listed below. The
standalone `.deb` and `.flatpak` files are covered by the checksums and
attestations below.

### Build provenance (all assets)

Every release asset, including `SHA256SUMS`, carries a GitHub build
provenance attestation binding it to the exact commit and workflow run that
produced it. Verify with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

    gh attestation verify <file> --repo lejeanbaptiste/lejeanbaptiste

### Checksums

`SHA256SUMS`, attached to each release, contains SHA-256 digests of all
release assets:

    sha256sum --check --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS

### Windows

Windows builds are currently unsigned; SmartScreen will warn on install.
Signed MSIX packages distributed through the Microsoft Store are planned.

## Signing keys

Le Jean-Baptiste releases are covered by the same release-signing key as
marinaMoji, published in the marinaMoji repository
(`marinaMoji-release-public-key.asc`).

Primary key fingerprint (certification only; kept offline):

    5469 4B5D D8C8 DBEA 7DFE  F8F1 E40E 872A F7D7 CFEB

Subkeys:

- `35CC 9C65 3654 3F50 5825  2DDC FCDA 39EE 2E22 A192` — maintainer signing
  subkey, kept offline. Used for signatures made outside CI, such as
  security notices or key-rotation statements.
- `A1DF B08F D78B 8A8F 941E  AD5F E4A4 FB8B 462A 09F5` — CI signing subkey,
  held by GitHub Actions. Signs the apt repository metadata; it does not
  sign release assets.

Release assets are authenticated by notarization and build provenance
attestations (above), not by detached GPG signatures. Subkey expiries are
extended in place; re-fetch the archive key if apt reports an expired key.
