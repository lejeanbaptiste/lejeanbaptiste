# Authority databases (CBDB + DILA) — Work Phases

Companion to [authority-databases-planning.md](authority-databases-planning.md).
This slots into the auto-tagging Phase 4a "authority" mode; the no-ids-at-tag-stage
rule holds throughout — authority ids travel on suggestions but nothing is minted
until Phase 4b.

## Phase A0 — Language codes & gating

Smallest piece, unblocks everything else.

**Decide first:**
- [x] Code list: BCP-47 (`zh-Hant`, `zh-Hans`, `en`, `fr`, …) — do we distinguish Hant/Hans for gating, or gate on primary subtag `zh`? DPM: yes.
- [x] Where the setting lives: project schema? translation-pane language? both feeding one "project languages" set? DPM: project schema and translation pane both use languages, both will use fixed codes, one for the source documents, one for translation languages. Tagging and disambiguation only matter for the source document, its language is determined at the project level.
- [x] Migration for existing projects with free-text language values. DPM: if there's no language, reopen the project settings before allowing the user to proceed. Language is mandatory.

**Prepare:**
- [x] Replace free-text language entry with a fixed-code picker.
- [x] A single `isChineseEnabled(project)` predicate the rest of the feature keys off.

**Done when:** a project can declare Chinese via a fixed code, and non-Chinese projects see none of the new UI.

**Status (2026-07-04):** built.
- Fixed code list (BCP-47, incl. `zh-Hant`/`zh-Hans`/`lzh` Literary Chinese) lives in `packages/cwrc-leafwriter/src/utilities/languageCodes.ts`; light windows import it via the `@cwrc/leafwriter/languageCodes` alias (webpack + tsconfig) so native dialogs don't pull in the editor bundle.
- Project settings dialog (`NativeProjectMetadataPage`): "Source language" is now a required select (legacy free-text values stay selectable, marked "(legacy)"); Save buttons disable while it's empty. Translation languages are added from the same fixed list (label auto-filled); the free-text code/label inputs are gone.
- `normalizeLanguageIdent` now preserves hyphenated BCP-47 tags with canonical case (`zh-hant` → `zh-Hant`) instead of truncating them.
- Gate: `apps/commons/src/desktop/projectLanguage.ts` — `getProjectSourceLanguage(bundle)` / `isChineseEnabled(bundle)` (accepts `zh*`, `lzh`, legacy `chi`/`zho`). Orlando projects are exempt (no language field).
- Migration: `completeProjectOnboarding` blocks project open until a source language is saved (reopens the settings dialog; cancel = project doesn't open).

## Phase A1 — Download manager

**Decide first:**
- [x] Storage location: repo-level `databases/` vs. per-user app-data dir (desktop). Web app: probably unsupported at first — confirm desktop-only for v1. DPM: this will be alongside the user's central database wherever the user chose to install that. BTW, we didn't go through this while developping, so let's use test_project as our main folder, and corpus_a as our project. I've changed names already.
- [x] Download UX: settings section vs. prompt-on-first-Chinese-project. DPM: prompt on first Chinese project.

**Prepare:**
- [ ] Fetcher: CBDB zip from the HuggingFace URL (manifest JSON already gives URL + sha256), DILA person/place/districts XML from `DILA-edu/Authority-Databases` (pin a commit; record it in our manifest).
- [ ] Checksum verification, unzip, and a per-source manifest file (`source, version/date, sha256, upstream URL, installedAt`).
- [ ] Presence + valid-manifest check = source availability; nothing else in the app looks at the raw files.

**Done when:** from a Chinese project, the user can fetch both sources; a corrupted or missing file simply makes the source unavailable.

**Status (2026-07-04):** built.
- `apps/desktop/src/authorityDatabases.ts` (electron-free, unit-tested): source specs — CBDB zip pinned to the HuggingFace 20260627 release (sha256-verified sqlite, extracted via JSZip stream), DILA person/place/districts XML pinned to commit `385e3f55` (2026-06-30) on `DILA-edu/Authority-Databases`. Files download to `<entityDbFolder>/authority-databases/` under temp names, rename into place after hashing, manifest (`<id>.manifest.json`: version, per-file sha256/bytes/upstream URL, installedAt) written last — a crashed download never reads as installed.
- Availability = manifest parses + every listed file present with recorded size (`getAuthorityStatuses`); no other code touches the raw files.
- IPC: `authorityDb:statuses`, `authorityDb:download` (streams progress events, throttled; system notification on success/failure; concurrent-download guard), `authorityDb:promptDownload` (native dialog; decline is remembered via `download-declined.json` marker so the user isn't nagged — the A4 panel can still trigger downloads).
- Prompt-on-first-Chinese-project: `maybeOfferAuthorityDatabases` in commons, called fire-and-forget at the end of `completeProjectOnboarding` — project open is never blocked; missing-source check uses the same statuses IPC. Shared renderer types in `apps/commons/src/desktop/authorityDbTypes.ts`.
- Not yet exercised end-to-end with the full 600 MB CBDB download (URLs verified reachable; DILA files are the ones already in `databases/`).

## Phase A2 — Compile step — **partial (pre-compiled packs, 2026-07-05)**

Compile runs in the sibling [`authority extraction`](../../authority%20extraction/) repo (`npm run compile:cbdb`, `compile:dila`). LJB **loads** NDJSON from `<entityDbFolder>/authority-packs/`.

**Built:**

- [x] `packLoader.ts`, `packPaths.ts`, `runAuthorityTagBomb` on `AutoTaggingSession`
- [x] Desktop IPC: `authorityPack:statuses`, `authorityPack:read`, `authorityPack:installFrom`
- [x] Dialog: **Tag from authority packs (CBDB / DILA)** with source checkboxes
- [x] CBDB offices → `roleName`; `kind: office` on candidates (standoff `office` entity deferred to 4b)
- [x] `scripts/sync-authority-packs.mjs` — copy compiled packs into entity DB folder

**Install packs (dev):**

```bash
cd authority\ extraction && npm run compile:cbdb && npm run compile:dila
cd leaf-writer && node scripts/sync-authority-packs.mjs /path/to/entityDbFolder
```

**Still to do:**

- [x] Year-range slider + hide undated (A4)
- [ ] In-app compile from downloaded sqlite/XML — **superseded**: GitLab packs + optional raw reference ([authority-data-lifecycle.md](authority-data-lifecycle.md))
- [ ] Progress / memory profile on full 659k-person load

**Done when:** each downloaded source yields NDJSON artifacts; a golden test compiles a fixture slice of each source and snapshots the candidates (including clue lines). → **Met via authority extraction tests + packLoader tests.**

## Phase A3 — Matcher integration at scale

**Status (2026-07-05):** built for v1 tag bomb path.

**Decide first:**
- [x] Memory budget: stream NDJSON + build index incrementally (no 659k `push()`); date filter **before** index build.

**Prepare:**
- [x] Loader: seed index `Map<tag+surface, candidates[]>`; overlap merge **only** when DILA `idno type="CBDB"` crosswalk links to CBDB (`authorityOverlap.ts`). Same string without crosswalk → separate suggestions; user may link manually in disambiguation (4b).
- [x] Date-range filter at load time (`candidateIntersectsYearRange`).
- [x] Wire into seed matcher; suggestions carry `sourceDetail` + `rationale` clue.

**Still to do:**
- [ ] Formal memory/time profile on full pack load in desktop app.

**Done when:** with CBDB persons + DILA persons both selected and a date range set, a real document produces deduped suggestions with correct clue lines, at acceptable load time and memory. → **Met in app + opt-in harness (`authorityTagBombHarness.live.test`).**

## Phase A4 — Authority panel UI

**Status (2026-07-05):** partial.

**Decide first:**
- [x] Slider design: single year-range slider with dynasty presets as labeled stops (Eastern Han, Tang, Song, Ming–Qing).

**Prepare:**
- [x] Authority dialog: checkbox per pack, date slider, hide undated, install-from-source.
- [x] Review panel: source badge (`CBDB+DILA`), clue line (`rationale`); DILA disambiguation in clue when compiled.
- [x] Post-run notice: per-pack entry counts + match count.
- [x] Persist source + date selection per project (`autoTaggingAuthority` in project JSON).

**Still to do:**
- [ ] Review-panel: surface DILA disambiguation when **both** look-alikes match same span (needs candidate list on suggestion, not just merged clue).
- [ ] Per-source match counts in dialog (Markus-style), before run.

**Done when:** the full flow — pick sources, set period, run, review with clues — works end to end and unavailable sources are absent (not greyed). → **Mostly met; polish items above remain.**

## Phase A5 — Update checking & lifecycle

**Spec:** [authority-data-lifecycle.md](authority-data-lifecycle.md) (revised 2026-07-05) — **two-tier model**: tagging packs from **GitLab CI**, reference databases from **official upstream**.

**Decision (2026-07-05):** Do **not** compile on user machines for CBDB/DILA in production. GitLab builds NDJSON; LJB downloads binaries. Raw sqlite/XML remains a **separate optional tier** for entity enrichment (posting history, full TEI, coords, etc.) — not for tag matching.

**Built (spike, 2026-07-05):**

- [x] `lifecycle.json` schema + `authorityLifecycle:*` IPC (get, setEnabled, update, progress, prompt)
- [x] Settings → Authorities: offline toggle, update, open folder, disable confirm
- [x] Onboarding wired to lifecycle enable flag
- [x] In-app compile spike (`authorityCompile.ts`) — **dev fallback only**; replace with pack fetch

**Prepare (build next — in order):**

1. [x] **C3/D3** — GitLab CI in `authority extraction`: compile → tarball + `packs-index.json`
2. [x] LJB pack fetcher: `authorityPackRegistry.ts` — download bundle from GitLab artifacts, verify sha256, extract
3. [ ] **Reference data** checkbox (default off): keep A1 fetcher for `authority-databases/` when enabled
4. [ ] Throttled check (≤ weekly): pack registry manifest + upstream pins (if reference enabled)
5. [ ] “Update available” badge; on accept: refresh packs (+ raw if enabled). Never auto-replace mid-review
6. [ ] Disable: delete or keep both tiers

**Done when:** per [authority-data-lifecycle.md](authority-data-lifecycle.md) exit criteria — packs from GitLab, reference optional, no terminal for normal users.

## Phase A6 — Reference lookup (disambiguation enrichment)

**Spec:** [authority-data-lifecycle.md](authority-data-lifecycle.md) § two tiers.

**Purpose:** When the user picks or inspects a CBDB/DILA candidate in Phase 4b, show **rich fields** from the raw database (beyond the pack clue line) and optionally write `<note type="authority-cache">` on `entities.xml`.

**Prepare:**

- [ ] `authorityRef:lookup(source, authorityId)` IPC — targeted sqlite query (CBDB) or TEI slice (DILA); no full-table load
- [ ] Renderer types + disambiguation panel hook (detail pane below candidate list)
- [ ] Field set v1: dates, dynasty, description/notes, birthplace/postings (CBDB); DILA `<note>`, placeOfOrigin ref
- [ ] Graceful degrade: pack-only clue when reference tier not installed

**Done when:** with reference data installed, selecting a CBDB person in disambiguation shows posting/dates not present in NDJSON; works offline.

## Phase H — CHGIS

Historical place pack + **local-only** delivery (Dataverse EULA — no GitLab redistribution). Compile track in `authority extraction` (`chgis/compile.mjs`); LJB **Settings → Authorities → Install from download…** (`authorityChgis.ts`).

## Deferred / future

- Wikipedia/VIAF/Wikidata: not a match source at tag time — use **authority packs** built in the [`authority extraction`](../authority%20extraction/) repo (see [authority-extraction.md](authority-extraction.md), [phases.md](../authority%20extraction/docs/phases.md)). VIAF/Wikidata idnos remain Phase 4b reconciliation when minting entities.
- **VIAF↔Wikidata precompiled concordance (long-term)** — 2026-07-07: the Phase 4b disambiguation panel (live LINCS reconcile, not the packs) currently cross-links VIAF/Wikidata/CBDB rows by regex-scraping ids out of free-text reconcile descriptions (`extractWikidataId`/`extractViafId`/`extractCbdbId` in `disambiguationCandidates.ts`) — fragile by construction (e.g. a locale-prefixed VIAF permalink `viaf.org/fr/viaf/…` silently broke merging until patched 2026-07-07). The correct fix is a precompiled crosswalk, same pattern as the CBDB/DILA `metadata.crosswalk` baked in at pack-compile time. Blocked on a Wikidata-persons pack recompile (not scheduled yet) and on VIAF bulk-dump access being gated/unstable post the Jan 2025 OCLC interface overhaul (see research notes, 2026-07-07 session). **For now: keep the regex-based runtime cross-linking** in the live panel; revisit as part of the next Wikidata pack recompile.
- Web-app support (databases are desktop-filesystem for now).
- DILA `ana` values other than `historical` — flag mythical/uncertain in the clue?
- Other authority sources behind the same source-manifest interface (Korean sets à la Markus, local gazetteers).
